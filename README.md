# Description
Calculating the number of holes of 1.5 mm2 diameter necessary on an injector plate for a flow of 1.2 Kg/s of nitrous based on data retrieved from a coldflow.

We measured the pressure in the tank manifold and in the pinhole during the entirety of the test. The data needed some adjustments as the temperature in the tank couldn't be kept constant so our flow got choked at some point.

The first 3 sheet are for raw data collected from using plates with 75%, 100%, and 125% of the cross-section area needed theoretically. The next 3 sheet are adjusted for only the part of the flow, and not the entire pressurizing process. The results are on the final sheet.

The updated injector plate CAD is attached with its drawing.
