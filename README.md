Calculating the number of holes of 1.5 mm2 diameter necessary on an injector plate for a flow of 1.2 Kg/s of nitrous based on data retrieved from a coldflow.

We measured the pressure in the tank and in the manifold during the entirety of the flow. The data needed some adjustments as the temperature in the tank couldn't be kept constant.
